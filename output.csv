me the second critical', 'factor', 'is making contact 2.2 inches up from the', 'bottom of the ball', 'extensive research has been done that', 'backs up these two factors as the most', 'critical', 'for maximizing distance so after that he', 'showed me the proper technique', 'to achieve those two factors so you come', 'in an angle so your', 'plant leg should be as close as straight', 'as you can and

fundamentally we've got a"", 'hub', 'attached to an axle here it can freely', 'rotate and if you slap a kicking leg on', 'the end', 'they both rotate together then if you', 'put a winch on this side

the', 'ball straight on', 'we also tried to determine the best foot', 'diameter as well as the best spot to', 'make contact with the ball but i still', 'wanted even more power which was tricky', 'because there was already so much force', 'that we busted our industrial strength', 'quick release', ""which is why there's a loose bolt in the"", 'frame here which is just', 'never something you

advantage by making the', 'diameter of the leg sprocket twice as', 'small as the driving sprocket so it', 'rotated twice as far but in the same', 'amount of time which means we doubled', 'the speed with a big build like this', 'you are only as strong as your weakest', 'link so this process of prototyping', 'failing and fixing', 'helps flush out all the weak links as', 'quickly as possible',
