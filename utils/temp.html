      <td>Christmas morning explosion rocks downtown Nashville</td>
      <td>A Christmas morning explosion that rocked downtown Nashville, injuring at least three people and damaging dozens of buildings, is believed to be an intentional act, authorities said.\nAccording to police, officers with the Metro Nashville Police Department were responding to a call of shots fired around 5:30 a.m. CT Friday when they came upon an RV parked in front of an AT&amp;T transmission building at 166 2nd Avenue North.\nThe RV was playing a recorded message that indicated a bomb would explode in 15 minutes, Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said during a news conference Friday.\nOfficers saw no immediate evidence of shots fired but they requested the department's hazardous devices unit and started to evacuate neighborhood residents, police said.\nThe bomb squad was responding when the RV exploded at 6:30 a.m. CT, police spokesman Don Aaron said.\n"We do believe this to have been an intentional act," he said. "Significant damage has been done to the infrastructure there on 2nd Avenue North."\nThree people were transported to hospitals from the scene, but none were in critical condition, according to Nashville Fire spokesman Joseph Pleasant.\n#Nashville #CNN #News</td>

      <td>House GOP kills bid for $2,000 stimulus checks, Democrats vow full house vote</td>
      <td>The House of Representatives failed to advance a measure that would increase direct payments to Americans under a certain income level to $2,000 -- up from the $600 level passed earlier this week -- bringing lawmakers back to square one as they search for a way to appease President Donald Trump's demands.\nHouse Democrats tried to quickly pass the bill by a unanimous consent request Thursday morning, but Republicans rejected the move, leaving the future of the $900 billion stimulus package -- and whether any changes will be added to it -- in doubt. That stimulus package was attached to a spending bill for the entire federal government, and a deadline for government funding expires Monday at midnight.\nDemocrats have seized on Trump's surprise objections to the bill in a bid to push Republicans to accept a higher amount for the stimulus checks -- and Republican lawmakers are now in a difficult spot where they will be forced to decide whether or not they will defy the President.\nDemocrats vowed their effort isn't over, promising to move to pass a bill to increase the stimulus checks to $2,000 with a full up-or-down vote on the House floor December 28.\n"On Monday, I will bring the House back to session where we will hold a recorded vote on our stand-alone bill to increase economic impact payments to $2,000. To vote against this bill is to deny the financial hardship that families face and to deny them the relief they need," Pelosi said in a statement.\n\n#CNN #News</td>
